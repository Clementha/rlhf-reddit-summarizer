Prompt:     I'm loath to knock what's working, but I just wanted to double-check if this is something normal.

I abruptly changed my unhealthy diet into a healthy one about two months ago. Every other time I've tried losing weight, I tried following all the common advice out there: eat breakfast, eat several small meals throughout the day, eat no less than 1200 calories every day, all that stuff. And every time, I was miserable, irritable, constantly ate well over my calorie limit, and eventually gave up entirely.

This time around, I decided to just stick to nutritious foods and aim for 1100-1300 calories a day with none of those other rules. The first week, it was hard to stick in the range, but in the next several weeks, I never went over (with pretty much no effort). Then maybe 2-3 weeks ago, I developed this sort of eating rhythm that cycles every 3 days or so. 

* Day 1, I have virtually no appetite. I'll eat only nutritionally-dense foods and average a few hundred calories. 

* Day 2, I'm somewhat hungrier than day 1, but not much. I might do 700
Output:     -1000 calories in this day, too.

Prompt:     My brother and I are twins, and we have an older sister. I've had a few boyfriends before and she didn't care at all, if anything she was proud of me and thought it was cute that I'm growing up or whatever. But my brother is dating his first girlfriend now and she cares so much about it. When she first met her she posted something on twitter like meeting her little brothers gf and wanting to scare her. But she was always nice to my boyfriends, I'm not saying I'd like her to be mean obviously but it just seems like she doesn't care about me as much. Like she is always asking if things are okay and worrying about him, talking about like red flags to know if she is bad or something, and it makes me feel like she doesn't love me or she just cares more about him than about me and it makes me kind of jealous. 

Is this normal? I think we're equally close with her and she doesn't mistreat me or anything but I don't feel like she is as protective of me as she is of him even though him and I are the same age and we're both her younger siblings. Should I tell her about this or just let it go?

Prompt:     We've been together since we were 14. He goes to college while I work in another town (so we are long-distance) and although he makes a lot of effort to make things right, it's just not working. 

Since last year, I've been feeling less interested. I've never had the chance to be single, and part of me is interested in trying it. I know most people say that the single life sucks, so maybe I'm just glorifying it. But I made friends who are single and they seem to accept themselves a lot more than I can accept myself...they look to their futures, while I usually just look to my guy.

I can't help but wonder if we should spend some time apart. This is really upsetting to both of us, but instead of getting angry he lets me know it's my decision and he wants me to be happy. I don't want to break up and ruin everything, but I do worry about my commitment issues.

Prompt:     My girlfriend and I have been dating for three and a half years.  We were together throughout college and now we no longer live within two minutes walk from each other.  I currently live an hour plane flight from her.  

It has been three months and we have only seen each other twice.  We think it will get easier to see each other once we are settled, but I am not sure.  I am not leaving my job to be near her and she is in grad school so she will be there for another 5 years.  I am not sure if I can handle 5 years like this.  

However, I also don't want to end what we have just because it's difficult now.  

I am looking for advice on what to do. I don't want to lose her, but I also don't want to spend three years getting progressively less happy with the situation until we end up breaking up and disliking each other.  Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks.

Prompt:     Hi, I'm from California and my grandma has been in a sticky situation with her home.

A neighbor next door to my grandma was seeking reimbursement for repairs since there were holes in their house that came from my grandma's yard.

But it turns out the previous owner of my grandma's house caused those damages. 

So after inspections and everything, the neighbor's insurance reimbursed him about $1600 to make the repairs.

Now's the sticky part: The insurance company's lawyers sent a letter to my grandma asking for reimbursement for what they paid the neighbor. 

We've tried contacting our home insurance to deal with them but have been getting no calls back. We were thinking of writing a letter to OUR insurance company including the letter from the neighbor's lawyer and let them handle everything.

My grandma is just worried about losing the house. Thank you guys so much in advance.

Prompt:     My boyfriend and I have been together for five years and would like to publicize our engagement in 6 months. His family feels dating is a sin hence I have never met them. We rather not shock his parents so we felt me being introduced as a friend six months before hand is a good idea. 

She will meet me and another friend of his as she drops some food off nexr week at my boyfriend's apartment. I don't think the exchange will last for more than five minutes but as expected I am very nervous. I do not want it to become evident during the exchange that I am his girlfriend nor do I want her to see me as someone not swell enough to be his son's friend.

How should I do this? I want to make it perfect. Any tips?

Prompt:     OK. So I went out with this girl for about 2 months, and she is a senior and I'm a sophomore. We both said that we liked each other a lot and really fast, and that we wished we had started dating sooner. She had a lot more stress on her mind, and couldn't go out as much as we wanted to. She ended up breaking it off b/c of some trust issues and external pressure. I was sad, but quickly got over it b/c it was so short.
About 2 weeks later, after not talking at all, she calls me and says that she was sorry about us, and that she still wanted me to be in her life. We reasoned at the time it was better to be friends. We were just friends for a while, but then we both started to flirt a lot, and then she completely drew away: total cold shoulder. Since then we've warmed up but are barely talking. I can't stop thinking about her, and I think she still likes me. What do I do?

Prompt:     I have a Miniature Schnauzer, about 1 1/2 years old. Normally she's very sweet and playful, and she loves to cuddle and be a lap dog. But lately she's also taken to growling when she's moved or disturbed while sleeping - not much, just sort of a low gurgle. We didn't think anything of it previously, just chalking it up to grumpyness about being woken up.

Today, though, I was sitting at the computer, with the dog sleeping next to me on the couch. I bent down to cuddle my head against her and she reared around and bit me on the nose, hard enough to draw blood. I've never had a dog do anything like that before, and she's never shown any inclination to bite out of anger before this. How do I proceed?

Long story short after 7 months of weekly fights and nothing changing despite my efforts, I felt it was time to call it.  There are still feelings, there always are - break ups don't hurt because we don't feel things.

The thing is we were long distance, and I made a lot of things for her to remind her of what we had.  She is going through them now and is feeling stuff.  Every time she comes across something, she texts me. I don't want to know what she's feeling. I can't trust that she isn't trying to keep me on the hook anyway possible.

It's at the point where she fills my inbox with texts.  I'm talking 10-20 new messages an hour.  Phone calls and voicemails.  She won't stop and I can't heal.  How do I stop this?

Prompt:     For the last 2-3 weeks, I've been speaking with a guy from tinder. We now text rather than use the app, and we speak on a daily basis. We don't really 'chat' but more exchange a few long messages every day with little stories that happened to us.
I'm not sure when I should meet with him and how this will work. We know enough about each other to not be able to ask all the basic questions, yet not enough to have conversation like friends would. Thus, I'm also not sure how the date would go?
I do like this guy - he's funny and nice and I'm really hoping that things work out.

Luckily, she starts talking to me again, we start hanging out again, only it seems more serious this time. Things seems to be going well then bang, she tries to kill herself (long story, not related to me). She lives thankfully, I go and visit her in the hospital until she gets transferred to a mental health facility, where only the patients can call you, you can't call the patients. I send her letters all of the time, only I haven't heard from her in a week, and I realize I'm desperately in love with this girl. I don't know now if she even wants to be with me when she gets out. I've been drinking a lot more than I should be at this point, I've even taken up smoking just to calm my nerves. The question is, what the fuck do I do?

It has always been assumed by my family that I would study English as "you can do anything with an English degree." However my real passion and dream is to become a photojournalist, not that I couldn't do that after my degree, it's just as I got closer to university (applying for accommodation etc.) I had the feeling my life was going to end and it's something I'm going to regret.

Prompt:     I (19m) have been cheated on in two of the three relationships I've ever had. The last girl I was dating told me a few months ago that she had been cheating on me, and I didn't know how to react at first. We tried to work our relationship out. She seemed ashamed of it, and acted like she still wanted to be together. I stupidly bought into it, and we worked things out for about another month. We broke up, and the next day, went out and had a fling with the same guy she cheated on me with, and shortly after is now seeing another guy. I know it's all stupid, and I really shouldn't care, but I've been really down lately. My relationship with my parents haven't been that great since middle school, I'm in my first year of college, facing academic probation because of my GPA, and my friends only really seem to talk to me when they have some sort of problem with their life. Throw the whole cheating situation in, and... I just don't know what to do. It makes me wonder if something is wrong with me? I don't know.

We broke up, and the next day, went out and had a fling with the same guy she cheated on me with, and shortly after is now seeing another guy. I know it's all stupid, and I really shouldn't care, but I've been really down lately. My relationship with my parents haven't been that great since middle school, I'm in my first year of college, facing academic probation because of my GPA, and my friends only really seem to talk to me when they have some sort of problem with their life. Throw the whole cheating situation in, and... I just don't know what to do. It makes me wonder if something is wrong with me? I don't know.

Prompt:     Our relationship is very strong and has been from day 1. I have nothing to hide and leave my FB on or my phone laying around with no password for access or anything like that. I'm very open with her because I trust her.

Today I was in the bathroom and she hopped on my computer to use Facebook. As I was still logged on, she saw that I had recently searched for a name of a person I was seeing about 2 years ago and had been for only a month or so at the time. She then saw that I routinely searched her name (which is true). The thing is, I use Facebook to creep. I like to just look at people's pictures and posts. As we are not friends on Facebook, I would have to type her name in which shows up on the activity wall on FB. So of course it looks bad as it shows I've searched her name once a week or so. I wouldn't sit their and gaze a pictures or read wall posts for long durations or anything like that. I'd pop on for a minute at most and then just look at something else.

I have zero feelings for this person and I absolutely love my girlfriend. I just like to creep people I used to hang out with just out of

Prompt:     I sometimes find myself in situations where I might feel a little jealous or insecure about a situation with my boyfriend. The other night I saw him looking at this bartender pretty frequently, she's pretty, they know each other because they work together (he's a musician and plays at the bar she works at). In fact, she got him the gig I saw him looking at her. 

Then he played a song for her she apparently requests every night he plays at the other bar she works at that he plays at (now he plays at two bars she bartends at). It was really hard for me to try to contain my jealousy. We ended up fighting about it, and he told me he isn't going to re-assure me all the time about our relationship...and "if I'm looking at other women in a 'longing manner' then why are you with me?" He gets very upset when I show/talk about any jealous...which only makes me feel worse because I don't understand why he's so defensive (other than the fact he hates jealousy). 

Is it wrong of me to want reassurance sometimes when I'm feeling jealous/insecure? Or is he wrong for saying he's not going to reassure me?

Prompt:     I'm gonna make this short,  I broke contact with my mother years ago she is a bi polar abusive former drug addict. For obvious reasons I chose to cut her out of my life she was a destructive force in my life and doing so has benefited me dramatically. My problem is that in light of this recent news I feel I might have some regrets if I don't speak to her before she dies. On the other hand the idea of her dying doesn't sadden me at all so idk if speaking to her would be worth the verbal abuse that will inevitably ensue. What should I do?

Prompt:     My sister and I are a few years apart and in our 30s. I am the youngest, she is the oldest. I am trying to figure out the best way to be supportive of her as she is working through her marriage problems. She randomly said she was going to visit for a few days, which caught me off guard. Unfortunately I made the mistake of telling her that I already had plans. I didn't realize until a little later that maybe she was reaching out because she needed to get out of the house and take some time away from her spouse.
  
She recently lost her job a few months ago and is stuck at home in a suburb area. They only have one car (they used to commute together) so I can only imagine how hard it is for her right now to be going through difficulties and stuck at home all day.  
  
She is not the type to reach out to me for help, especially with me being the younger sibling, so I feel bad that I missed out on this opportunity to show her support. I tried to tell her she was welcome to spend some time with me but it might have come across as being too charity-like. I honestly don't know.

I'm 17, he's 18. Just broke up after 1.5 years. 

So my boyfriend (now ex-boyfriend as of 8-15) told me that I had to choose between my career and him. My dream career is starting up my own bakery-cafe. It's been my life-long goal, and he knows that. The problem is that the college I want to go to is down in the lower 48, and he wants to stay in Alaska for college. He told me that if I really loved him I'd give up college and my dream career for him, and pick some other career that I don't like so I can stay with him. I asked him how he could be so selfish, and he replied saying I'm the selfish one for not picking him.

Story: Over the course of this semester, I have noticed a girl in one of my classes. I have not yet talked to her, but from how she dresses (band shirts, tattoos), and how she acts, I would love to get to know her. Note: I do not know anything about her other than she likes the same general things as I do (its a start).

However, my class is completely full, and everyone mostly sits in the same seat they always have. She is usually talking to classmates in the class before class starts. I cannot switch seats with anyone either (teacher takes attendance by if a seat is filled). I also do not see her outside this class.

What is a simple but smart way to initiate conversation with her? She sits several seats in front of me. Id love to get coffee or something with her, and move on as so. All and any advice is appreciated.

Note: I do not know anything about her other than she likes the same general things as I do (its a start).

However, my class is completely full, and everyone mostly sits in the same seat they always have. She is usually talking to classmates in the class before class starts. I cannot switch seats with anyone either (teacher takes attendance by if a seat is filled). I also do not see her outside this class.

What is a simple but smart way to initiate conversation with her? She sits several seats in front of me. Id love to get coffee or something with her, and move on as so. All and any advice is appreciated.

The situation you're describing is quite common and can occur in various social situations, especially within smaller or

There was this girl who I found to be the most perfect girl I have ever met. But, she she didn't like me back. At first I thought I had a chance. Things were going great. I felt like I was on top of the world. Her friends gave hints that I should ask her out. Unfortunately, she takes ages to respond to my texts and flakes out on the day of whenever I ask for us to hangout. The last message I ever got from her was when we finished high school.

Prompt:     My girlfriend (18f) broke up with me (19m) unexpectedly at the start of this week, we have been together for roughly two years. We live in different states (i moved to a different state last month) but we are dealing with it (she visits me, i visit her, we text, call, skype every day). It was weird, we were talking fine in the morning, then in the afternoon, she dropped the "i wish you best of luck in the future" story.

Okay, ill be honest, i have been a bit harsh on her. Recently some family issues have popped up and h've been visiting family in hospital and travelling a lot so I havent had much time to talk to her. She says she felt under-appreciated. I gave her that and apologized.
I've been a bit sad recently, haven't been out much, haven't made any friends in my new state so far. So i have been texting her lots, trying to comfort her, it's probably a bad idea but i do miss her. I also sent her a little gift via post yesterday (would have reached her today) but i have heard nothing back yet.

Prompt:     So as title states my moron brother shot a arrow through his sons arm. I don't care if it was an accident it was moronic to do what he did. He told his son to go pick something up near the target and he did. He decided this was a good time to shoot an arrow and it hit his son on the arm. 

His wife and daughters [40F, 16F, 14F,10F] refuse to believe this was an accident. His wife divorced him and nothing could change her mind about it.  They think even if it was a mistake, it's unforgivable to shoot an bow and arrow around a child when he is near the target. My nieces have become super protective of my nephew since that day. Their mother tells me they play with him all the time. 

My brother keeps pressuring me to get his daughters and ex wife to speak to him. It's getting to the point where he calls me in the middle of the night to make it happen. How do I get him to stop?

Prompt:     I have a 1 year old, 70 lb pit. This morning I woke up to my dog puking up liquid/bile at 5:30 am. He hasn't puked in a LONG time so it was random. 

I took him out to go to the bathroom/walk and then fed him, he seemed fine. I left for work at 7 and he was in his crate until 1 when I came home. There was no puke in his crate and he was acting totally normal. I fed and walked him again. 

At 6 he puked up what looked like ALL of his kibble, then some bile. I just took him out and he was acting normal and trying to play with the other dogs and he pooped normal too. He was SLIGHTLY less hyper than normal, but still in his range of behavior.  

*some notes:*

-he is allergic to chicken and pumpkin. He has not had any, though. 

-the only new thing in his recent diet is a new antler chew, and new sweet potatoe treats. He's had both of these things in the past with no issues. We added these things 6 days ago, when he probably hasn't had either

My grandma grow up during the second worldwar, at the border to germany, with the permanent fear of a invade. Luckily we weren't invaded. But the years after the war, and with it her youth, were a hard time. She and my granddad live on their farm. It's now run by my uncle. But they are still active and help when they can.

Prompt:     Hi, I'm from California and my grandma has been in a sticky situation with her home.

A neighbor next door to my grandma was seeking reimbursement for repairs since there were holes in their house that came from my grandma's yard.

But it turns out the previous owner of my grandma's house caused those damages. 

So after inspections and everything, the neighbor's insurance reimbursed him about $1600 to make the repairs.

Now's the sticky part: The insurance company's lawyers sent a letter to my grandma asking for reimbursement for what they paid the neighbor. 

We've tried contacting our home insurance to deal with them but have been getting no calls back. We were thinking of writing a letter to OUR insurance company including the letter from the neighbor's lawyer and let them handle everything.

My grandma is just worried about losing the house. Thank you guys so much in advance.

Prompt:     My boyfriend and I are long distance. We have a trip planned this summer which involves me going over to him in the USA. This will be the second time I have actually been with him in person. I am flying from the UK with my mum to the east coast. The original plan was for me to fly over to my boyfriend in the west coast (my parents are holidaying on the east coast) but because my mum was freaking out so much about me going to meet my boyfriend i said we can all road trip there together. I even invited her on the trip with us. I have given her all of our dates so that she can travel around with us.

The plan was for me to stay on the 4th July and fly back on the 5th. Mum knew this. I told her I had booked a flight back already from the west coast to east coast (where she would pick me up and we would fly back to the UK together). She has gone mad at me because she can't believe I would book a flight when she told me she didn't want me flying on my own. At the time I had booked it she told me she wasn't gonna road trip with us. She knew the trip was happening.......how else was I to

Prompt:     Okay. I've always had these bouts of depression, for as long as I can remember. But I hid them well. It wasn't until sophomore year of high school (I snuck out at midnight to meet a friend because I was feeling like I was about to commit suicide) that my mom found out I was ever this sad. The past summer, it kind of overtook me again. I barely left the house. I gained weight, which helped me to develop bulimia, which compounded the depression. I felt worthless. 

This carried into the school year, and as a result, my grades started suffering. I used to be a straight-A student, but I found myself unable to summon up the motivation to even turn in homework.

Prompt:     I made a post three weeks ago basically saying I'm happy with my progress so far but it hasn't really made much difference in my appearance. Post here: 

This week I've had more than a dozen people remark on my weight loss (still the same weight/only two pounds down compared to where I was three weeks ago), several of which when I've responded with "yeah a little bit. thanks." Have remarked that it's more than a little bit. One person who despite me saying I feel great, I'm a powerhouse and starting to flex comically to give her the gun show kept saying I was getting too thin and shouldn't lose anymore (I actually found it a bit rude how much she pushed it even though I'm sure it's coming from a good space). I'm 5'4" and 140 so I'm not at risk of starving anytime soon.

I'm just so confused as to this sudden seemingly global perception shift. Does this happen to everyone?

My best friend and I have been like sisters since high school. We are also both engaged. Both our weddings are far away, but there was no doubt in my mind that she was going to be my maid of honor and I was going to be hers, as we had talked about it several times over the years. 

Cut to today when we had lunch. After some alcohol, she informed me that there was "not going to be room for me in her bridal party" but that I was "still invited to the event and it would still be a good time."

I'm crushed! I understand that it's her wedding and she needs to do what is going to make her happy, but that doesn't change the fact that I am deeply hurt that one of my oldest, closest friends doesn't consider me close enough to even make me a bridesmaid. Moreover, she made it sound like I was only invited to the wedding at all because she felt bad. 

This is so out of left field that I feel like I need an explanation as to why she would cut me out this way, but I'm afraid of

Prompt:     I am 29 and have been stuck in (various levels of) social isolation for the past 8 years since my relationship with my ex-girlfriend ended. 

Just to make things clear, my social isolation is a result of depression and anxiety issues related to autism. It's not related to the breakup with my ex. I have been in therapy and my life is sort of getting back on track again

For 2016 I would love to start dating again through online dating sites, but I have absolutely no idea what to expect from dating at my age. 

What can I expect from first dates?
What are good ideas for dates?
Do you split expenses when meeting someone for the first time or do I pay for things?
I figure the past few years may come up, how do I communicate such a thing? (I know that some people will end things here when I do bring it up, that's fine. But I'm sure there are people out there who understand)

Any overall tips for dating women in their late 20's and early 30's would be well appreciated.

I've had a few boyfriends before and she didn't care at all, if anything she was proud of me and thought it was cute that I'm growing up or whatever.

Like she is always asking if things are okay and worrying about him, talking about like red flags to know if she is bad or something, and it makes me feel like she doesn't love me or she just cares more about him than about me and it makes me kind of jealous. 

Is this normal? I think we're equally close with her and she doesn't mistreat me or anything but I don't feel like she is as protective of me as she is of him even though him and I are the same age and we're both her younger siblings. Should I tell her about this or just let it go?

Prompt:     Our relationship is very strong and has been from day 1. I have nothing to hide and leave my FB on or my phone laying around with no password for access or anything like that. I'm very open with her because I trust her.

Today I was in the bathroom and she hopped on my computer to use Facebook. As I was still logged on, she saw that I had recently searched for a name of a person I was seeing about 2 years ago and had been for only a month or so at the time. She then saw that I routinely searched her name (which is true). The thing is, I use Facebook to creep. I like to just look at people's pictures and posts. As we are not friends on Facebook, I would have to type her name in which shows up on the activity wall on FB. So of course it looks bad as it shows I've searched her name once a week or so. I wouldn't sit their and gaze a pictures or read wall posts for long durations or anything like that. I'd pop on for a minute at most and then just look at something else.

I have zero feelings for this person and I absolutely love my girlfriend. I just like to creep people I used to hang out with just out of

Recently I mustered the courage to ask a girl in one of my classes out, and a few weeks later were getting along just fine hanging out a few times a week we've kissed and slept in the same bed a few times. 

My issue is that she has this guy friend, for the life of me I have no idea if I'm just being a jealous lonely idiot but I cant help but shake the feeling that she likes him. Last week I was hanging out with them when she sat on his lap and acted all flirty around him, later apologizing when she saw that I could not hide my disgust but today after i went to a campus event with her and told her i wont be able to see her for a few days she let slip that shes going to hang out with him tonight while I go back to my room alone. I feel soo very shitty and I dont know if i should text her or talk to her to let her know how i feel or ask her if she does like him and im wasting my time, or not say anything in fear of ruining a new relationship I really want

Prompt:     So recently my girlfriend (21 y/o) from college of about a semester broke up with me (20 y/o) because she said I didn't really argue with her friends when they talked about me and I would sit there and ignore them. She said it made her feel like more of the man in the relationship.

She talked to me about this before and I personally thought that it wasn't that serious and thought by responding with at least something she would be happy but it seems like it didn't work. 

I actually kinda wonder if it's worth trying to get back together, because isn't it possible she's trying to change me? I have feelings for her still and feel she's an open target for dudes now.

Prompt:     Hi, I'm from California and my grandma has been in a sticky situation with her home.

A neighbor next door to my grandma was seeking reimbursement for repairs since there were holes in their house that came from my grandma's yard.

But it turns out the previous owner of my grandma's house caused those damages. 

So after inspections and everything, the neighbor's insurance reimbursed him about $1600 to make the repairs.

Now's the sticky part: The insurance company's lawyers sent a letter to my grandma asking for reimbursement for what they paid the neighbor. 

We've tried contacting our home insurance to deal with them but have been getting no calls back. We were thinking of writing a letter to OUR insurance company including the letter from the neighbor's lawyer and let them handle everything.

My grandma is just worried about losing the house. Thank you guys so much in advance.

Prompt:     In about a year, I will be moving out of my parents house and in with my grandmother. I had planned to take my dog with me, but lately have been doubting that it is the best thing for her. She is a 10 year old lab, and has arthritis in her back legs. We have two other dogs, one of which is still a puppy. The puppy plays very rough with her, in fact just ten minutes ago she literally leapt down a half a flight of stairs and landed on top of the older dog. I was thinking that it would benefit her to get away from away from that. My fear is that separating her from the other two dogs, as well as the rest of the human members of the family, will cause more harm than good. She has always been most attached to me though, so I would feel like I was abandoning her if she stayed behind. She has never in her life been the only dog in the house, and as such hasn't ever been home alone without at least another dog around. This won't be the case if she moves with me. What does reddit think? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

The other issue is we live about 3 hours drive from each other, what should I do? I'm happy to drive to her every now and then, but just not sure what to make of it.

Prompt:     My girlfriend was in town visiting from school this weekend and her dad caught us having sex in my car. It seemed like movie when it happened.

I've been thinking of ways to handle the situation but I still have not come up with any great ideas. My best one so far is to go over to her house unannounced and ask to speak with her father one on one. Not sure how great of an idea this is and also not sure how long I should wait.

Prompt:     Hi, I'm from California and my grandma has been in a sticky situation with her home.

A neighbor next door to my grandma was seeking reimbursement for repairs since there were holes in their house that came from my grandma's yard.

But it turns out the previous owner of my grandma's house caused those damages. 

So after inspections and everything, the neighbor's insurance reimbursed him about $1600 to make the repairs.

Now's the sticky part: The insurance company's lawyers sent a letter to my grandma asking for reimbursement for what they paid the neighbor. 

We've tried contacting our home insurance to deal with them but have been getting no calls back. We were thinking of writing a letter to OUR insurance company including the letter from the neighbor's lawyer and let them handle everything.

My grandma is just worried about losing the house. Thank you guys so much in advance.

Prompt:     Hi all,

I've been thinking about this for some time and I'm wondering if I should pursue this course.

I have 2 older cousins both of whom I care for dearly that left the family (they're twins). They left the family for completely different reasons, one for prison the other for extended military service and a marriage.

I want to get in contact with them but Facebook doesn't work, old emails are closed, and old cellphone numbers obviously don't work. I have some idea why they wanted to go No Contact with certain members, but not sure why this would extend to me.

These two were like older brothers to me, and I'm hoping to at least establish an email relationship. Does r/legal have any advice regarding PI's or anything for this situation? I'm in completely new territory.

*I would only want to contact them so that I could talk to them, not for anyone else.*

Combined:  I live in a dorm room on a campus that has 20,000 students and only about 1/5 of them live on campus. The IT department at my school has throttled bandwidth substantially. On campus, using a university computer, I can get down/up speeds of 40Mbps during peak hours and upwards of 100Mbps during off hours. In the dorms, I only get speeds of 1Mbps on average. I want to write some kind of report or petition to send to the IT department but I don't know about whether this kind of thing has been successful in the past. Does anyone have any experience in the matter?

Prompt:     Two and a half years ago I left my wife. I was horribly unhappy with her. I had serious anxiety issues and she was only too happy to ignore me. Our kid was 3 at the time. After I left my wife, I had sex with my Dad's cousin. I still cannot believe that I did it. Worse, she became pregnant and carried the baby to term. I have never met or seen this child. I feel that I did the right thing in leaving my wife, but what I did afterward disgusts me and I feel like my life is essentially over. The only reason I continue on is my kid with my ex.

Prompt:     My sister and I are a few years apart and in our 30s. I am the youngest, she is the oldest. I am trying to figure out the best way to be supportive of her as she is working through her marriage problems. She randomly said she was going to visit for a few days, which caught me off guard. Unfortunately I made the mistake of telling her that I already had plans. I didn't realize until a little later that maybe she was reaching out because she needed to get out of the house and take some time away from her spouse.
  
She recently lost her job a few months ago and is stuck at home in a suburb area. They only have one car (they used to commute together) so I can only imagine how hard it is for her right now to be going through difficulties and stuck at home all day.  
  
She is not the type to reach out to me for help, especially with me being the younger sibling, so I feel bad that I missed out on this opportunity to show her support. I tried to tell her she was welcome to spend some time with me but it might have come across as being too charity-like. I honestly don't know.

Prompt:     I originally was expecting to move into my new apartment in August, but due to some instability at the time, I was forced to stay with a friend and wait until this month to move in. Today, I received a message from them asking if I was still moving in, and responded that I was since I was receiving my bi-weekly paycheck that would give me enough to pay this month's rent of about $350 (along with a few necessities).
They then proceeded to tell me that if I did move in, I would also have to pay the whole first month's rent on top of that, even though I wasn't even living there. I would understand a holding fee, but paying $350 just to hold a spot is utterly ridiculous. I've done the math, and by the time I do get the full $700 or so, it would be time for next month's rent, which would add another $350 on top of that. That means I would essentially have to earn over $1000 in less than a month, literally impossible for someone on my salary.
And here's the icing on the cake; if I decide NOT to move in, they still want to charge me full rent for August AND September

He picked up a pricey item of mine that I inadvertently left behind while working as a group out of state over a year ago. He lost the item.
I was speaking to him last week and he tells me he's purchased a replacement for me (it's approx $70.00).
Strikes me as a bit odd he would replace it over a year later?
I avoided interactions with him until recently so maybe talking to me has caused this?

I was making up silly comments ala superman and said "wears underpants on her head!" And he retorts "I've never done that"
So I was cheeky and said "worn my underpants on your head? That would be weird"
He responded back "lol, no. But I thought about it"

I waffle back and forth between thinking he still likes me and he doesn't and I'm misreading his actions?

Prompt:     Im 20m shes 20f

Gf of 2.5 years recently ended it with me because she didn't feel the same way about me any more. The best thing I can do is realise that its just the end of one chapter in my life, and make it as easy for her as possible by not being a dick about it.

She obviously still cares about me, we've been best friends for 3 years, and she's said herself that she doesn't want to loose me as a friend. I don't want to lose her either, I'm not going to be creepy or weird or try and win her back, but she's a great chick and even though I'm still in love with her I'm not going to let my feelings mess things up, especially since we have mutual friends.

It hurts lots, I keep thinking about all the things we never got to do, and remembering all the great things we did, I miss her like crazy. But in a previous break up I learnt that things won't change just because I want them too, so its best for both of us if I try to make things easy.

Prompt:     Background: Back in September 2012, I went through a horrible breakup with my ex girlfriend, causing me to fail out of my Sophomore year of college and move from my old college to a community college. Our relationship, both our first, lasted 2 years.

Story: Over the course of this semester, I have noticed a girl in one of my classes. I have not yet talked to her, but from how she dresses (band shirts, tattoos), and how she acts, I would love to get to know her. Note: I do not know anything about her other than she likes the same general things as I do (its a start).

However, my class is completely full, and everyone mostly sits in the same seat they always have. She is usually talking to classmates in the class before class starts. I cannot switch seats with anyone either (teacher takes attendance by if a seat is filled). I also do not see her outside this class.

What is a simple but smart way to initiate conversation with her? She sits several seats in front of me. Id love to get coffee or something with her, and move on as so. All and any advice is appreciated.
Output:      I would consider being an office assistant as a future career.

Prompt:     I've been flirting on and off with a bartender at a bar I go to after work in town. We seem compatible, she's got a great personality, and is very attractive. I was a little tipsy but I had enough courage to tell her I'd like to take her to dinner. She said she had a busy next few days, but she handed me a slip of paper with her number on it and gave me a smile.

It's been a while since I've been in the dating scene ... I tend to be a bit of a loner. And now that the liquid confidence is gone, I need your help. Are there general guidelines to follow when it comes to following-up after a woman has given you her number? I know this may sound like an incredibly immature question but I have very little experience when it comes to dating.

I figured I would wait until maybe tomorrow, and follow-up with her via (text? phone call?) about when she might be free? She won't be working again until Friday. Appreciate your help, thank you!

Prompt:     Hi, I'm from California and my grandma has been in a sticky situation with her home.

A neighbor next door to my grandma was seeking reimbursement for repairs since there were holes in their house that came from my grandma's yard.

But it turns out the previous owner of my grandma's house caused those damages. 

So after inspections and everything, the neighbor's insurance reimbursed him about $1600 to make the repairs.

Now's the sticky part: The insurance company's lawyers sent a letter to my grandma asking for reimbursement for what they paid the neighbor. 

We've tried contacting our home insurance to deal with them but have been getting no calls back. We were thinking of writing a letter to OUR insurance company including the letter from the neighbor's lawyer and let them handle everything.

My grandma is just worried about losing the house. Thank you guys so much in advance.

Prompt:     My sister and I are a few years apart and in our 30s. I am the youngest, she is the oldest. I am trying to figure out the best way to be supportive of her as she is working through her marriage problems. She randomly said she was going to visit for a few days, which caught me off guard. Unfortunately I made the mistake of telling her that I already had plans. I didn't realize until a little later that maybe she was reaching out because she needed to get out of the house and take some time away from her spouse.
  
She recently lost her job a few months ago and is stuck at home in a suburb area. They only have one car (they used to commute together) so I can only imagine how hard it is for her right now to be going through difficulties and stuck at home all day.  
  
She is not the type to reach out to me for help, especially with me being the younger sibling, so I feel bad that I missed out on this opportunity to show her support. I tried to tell her she was welcome to spend some time with me but it might have come across as being too charity-like. I honestly don't know. Our parents are great, but have their own lives and are more hands
Output:     -off in life. They are great providers of care and support to us all.

Lately things have really changed between us. He is going through some pretty heavy family drama right now, and had a really abusive upbringing. He sees a therapist routinely which helps but has a very distracted and complex headspace. 

I'm still trying to understand his personality 100% because sometimes he is very difficult to read. He is not very forthcoming with telling me how he feels, both how into me he is or what's generally on his mind.

I want him to come to me for support when he's upset, not ice me out.

Prompt:     My girlfriend and I have been dating for three and a half years.  We were together throughout college and now we no longer live within two minutes walk from each other.  I currently live an hour plane flight from her.  

It has been three months and we have only seen each other twice.  We think it will get easier to see each other once we are settled, but I am not sure.  I am not leaving my job to be near her and she is in grad school so she will be there for another 5 years.  I am not sure if I can handle 5 years like this.  

However, I also don't want to end what we have just because it's difficult now.  

I am looking for advice on what to do. I don't want to lose her, but I also don't want to spend three years getting progressively less happy with the situation until we end up breaking up and disliking each other.  Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks.

He consistently plays the victim and brings up past instances of "charity" he has performed to negate hard evidence of his unruly behavior that is brought up. He dangles things over my head to make me feel bad. I'll go as far to say that he is an ignorant child and is a moral hazard.

Prompt:     Okay. I've always had these bouts of depression, for as long as I can remember. But I hid them well.

Prompt:     My boyfriend [M18] and I [F18] have been dating for about 7 months now. Early in the relationship he told me that he has some varied interests in the bedroom, cross-dressing being among them. 

At the time, it was just a theoretical interest, nothing he had pursued. I'm totally fine with him exploring in private. In fact, I've even participated in small amounts by teaching him about female clothing sizing and things like that. 

However, he has recently been exploring in small ways like wearing panties instead of boxers and learning to apply a small amount of makeup. The thought occurred to me that he may not be entirely straight. 

We've talked about it and he says that he doesn't know. We are both young, so that's understandable, I'm just starting to wonder what the implications for the relationship are going to be. We've been playfully planning a future together (I know it's early, but I really love this boy), but I can't help but to think about what would happen if he decided years from now that a traditional relationship isn't what he wants. 

Is this an early sign that he may need something else out of a relationship some day, or should I just love him

Prompt:     Basically, I was hammered with my friends. Somehow got split up with them, and ended up at this house a few blocks away from my own.

The house has a for sale sign on it, and I'm pretty sure there's no one living but they do have some stuff in the garage (where I ended up).

Anyway, my drunk train of thought was, "I need to sleep, no one lives here, let's get into the garage and pass the fuck out." I kicked the door open, laid down in front of an old car in there and went to sleep.

I woke up a few hours later, a little more sober, and suddenly very aware of my breaking and entering. I hightailed it out of there, not quite sure where I was (phone was dead), and eventually found my way home. When I got home, I realized that I had left my hat and prescription glasses in the garage.

I went back to see the house today, the garage door now has one of those big, black realtor's locks on it.

I'm willing to pay for any of the damage I caused, but I really need my hat and glasses back.

Prompt:     Hello reddit. My husky, Cleo, is a female husky and about 2 years old. About three days ago, we saw a radical change in her and later found out she ate the root part of a sago palm. We rushed her to a vet who referred us to a hospital where she went under 24 hour care. Well, luckily she threw up all of what she ate and her liver are back to normal levels as what the doctor had told us.

She is back home now and we are giving her medications that the hospital gave us. My question is...she seems so lethargic and almost depressed looking. Usually when she sees someone come through the door, she jumps, licks your face and starts running around the house like an energizer bunny. Lately, she's been the complete opposite and it is starting to worry me.

I've scheduled a follow up visit to her regular vet to check on her liver. Could this experience have traumatized her? Or maybe this might be side effects to the meds? Any advice? I would love to hear. Thanks.

Prompt:     Ugh so I'm a fucking idiot. I dropped my car off at my mechanics place after hours (left my key in a lockbox) to have it worked on tomorrow. I had $1300 cash in in an envelope with my registration. I forgot to take it with me when I left the car. 

I now have no way of getting to the car, or getting inside of it even if I could. I trust the owner of the place - I found him through a friend at church...he's an honest dude, and a genuinely good person. But the rest of the employees - I have no idea. 

All I can think of is to call as soon as they open and ask to speak to the owner...tell him I left it and ask him to keep it secure? 

If this gets stolen I'm completely fucked, right?

Prompt:     Background: Back in September 2012, I went through a horrible breakup with my ex girlfriend, causing me to fail out of my Sophomore year of college and move from my old college to a community college. Our relationship, both our first, lasted 2 years.

Story: Over the course of this semester, I have noticed a girl in one of my classes. I have not yet talked to her, but from how she dresses (band shirts, tattoos), and how she acts, I would love to get to know her. Note: I do not know anything about her other than she likes the same general things as I do (its a start).

However, my class is completely full, and everyone mostly sits in the same seat they always have. She is usually talking to classmates in the class before class starts. I cannot switch seats with anyone either (teacher takes attendance by if a seat is filled). I also do not see her outside this class.

What is a simple but smart way to initiate conversation with her? She sits several seats in front of me. Id love to get coffee or something with her, and move on as so. All and any advice is appreciated.

Prompt:     Hi, I'm from California and my grandma has been in a sticky situation with her home.

A neighbor next door to my grandma was seeking reimbursement for repairs since there were holes in their house that came from my grandma's yard.

But it turns out the previous owner of my grandma's house caused those damages. 

So after inspections and everything, the neighbor's insurance reimbursed him about $1600 to make the repairs.

Now's the sticky part: The insurance company's lawyers sent a letter to my grandma asking for reimbursement for what they paid the neighbor. 

We've tried contacting our home insurance to deal with them but have been getting no calls back. We were thinking of writing a letter to OUR insurance company including the letter from the neighbor's lawyer and let them handle everything.

My grandma is just worried about losing the house. Thank you guys so much in advance.
Output:      you were all super helpful. The situation you're describing is quite complex and involves multiple parties and legal

Prompt:    Hi, I'm from California and my grandma has been in a sticky situation with her home.

A neighbor next door to my grandma was seeking reimbursement for repairs since there were holes in their house that came from my grandma's yard.

But it turns out the previous owner of my grandma's house caused those damages. 

So after inspections and everything, the neighbor's insurance reimbursed him about $1600 to make the repairs.

For obvious reasons I chose to cut her out of my life she was a destructive force in my life and doing so has benefited me dramatically. My problem is that in light of this recent news I feel I might have some regrets if I don't speak to her before she dies. On the other hand the idea of her dying doesn't sadden me at all so idk if speaking to her would be worth the verbal abuse that will inevitably ensue. What should I do?

Prompt:     A few days ago, my boyfriend who I love a ton and see myself with forever semi-broke up with me. He told me he was scared he couldn't make me happy enough... that I needed too much and he wasn't sure he could give it to me. He said he thought this was something innate in me, that couldn't change.

I completely broke down, but then after an hour or so we realized this was a changeable thing (I've been taking him for granted. He does the most amazing things for me all the time, and I've just gotten used to it so haven't been appreciating it like I need to), so he decided he did not want to break up. He realized he should've just brought this issue up to me as a discussion a month ago when he started to feel it, but he didn't know how and was scared. He's introverted and not confrontational at all, whereas I bring up every issue I have with him because I think that's healthy. He promised that next time something comes up, he'll tell me right away instead of letting it build up in his head.

We had an amazing weekend together. He told me I'm the love of his life, that he knows 200

Prompt:     I'll try to keep this as short as I can, I'm also not good at writhing stories. 

Okay. I'll start from the beginning. I'm a third year med student and about 8 months ago I met this beautiful girl, also a med student. After two months we were in a commited relationship. Here is the catch: she's a muslim and because of this her parents dont know about us. I on the other hand am not a muslim, however I've been studying Islam for about 4+ years now. 

We thought we could make it work. We just have to keep it on a down low, meaning, we could only act like a couple in the university/other city/at my place. It worked in the beginning. We saw eachother a few times a week, but lately it has become a lot less.  Also, when we part ways, she's getting anxiety attacks more often. Thinking she might get caught. 

What might fix this is if we tell the parents, but as I stated before, there are some problems:
- I'm not a muslim yet (however I'm not going to convert only because of this)
- I'm not of the right ethnicity (she's morrocan and

Combined:   I'll try to keep this as short as I can, I'm also not good at writhing stories. 

Okay. I'll start from the beginning. I'm a third year med student and about 8 months ago I met this beautiful girl, also a med student. After two months we were in a commited relationship. Here is the catch: she's a muslim and because of this her parents dont know about us. I on the other hand am not a muslim, however I've been studying Islam for about 4+ years now. 

We thought we could make it work. We just have to keep it on a down low, meaning, we could only act like a couple in the university/other city/at my place. It worked in the beginning. We saw eachother a few times a week, but lately it has become a lot less.  Also, when we part ways, she's getting anxiety attacks more often. Thinking she might get caught. 

What might fix this is if we tell the parents, but as I stated before, there are some problems:
- I'm not a muslim yet (however I'm not going to convert only because of this)
- I'm not of the right ethnicity (she's morrocan and

I'm french). Therefore, I cannot get in touch with them. 
- I have no family

Prompt:     Hey /r/relationships! Have loved this subreddit for awhile and finally have something to ask!

I've been with R for just under 2 years and she's a smoker (4-5 smokes a day) that's gearing up for a big quit next week. She's got the patch, has a really well laid out plan and I want to be part of TEAM R in helping her kick it for good. One of the things she asked me for is some little bonuses or incentives for being quit 1 week, 1 month, 6 months.

Looking for general advice, support, ideas to help her and also great ideas for fun/cute incentives. We live in Canada, love camping, she's a candy-fiend and she's also into live music for a few background tidbits.

Prompt:     I originally was expecting to move into my new apartment in August, but due to some instability at the time, I was forced to stay with a friend and wait until this month to move in. Today, I received a message from them asking if I was still moving in, and responded that I was since I was receiving my bi-weekly paycheck that would give me enough to pay this month's rent of about $350 (along with a few necessities).
They then proceeded to tell me that if I did move in, I would also have to pay the whole first month's rent on top of that, even though I wasn't even living there. I would understand a holding fee, but paying $350 just to hold a spot is utterly ridiculous. I've done the math, and by the time I do get the full $700 or so, it would be time for next month's rent, which would add another $350 on top of that. That means I would essentially have to earn over $1000 in less than a month, literally impossible for someone on my salary.
And here's the icing on the cake; if I decide NOT to move in, they still want to charge me full rent for August AND September

She broke up with because she had feelings for a guy I used to be friends with and she didn't want to hurt me.  But after school today, she told me she messed up bad and really wants me back... She seems to mean it and I really like her, I just don't want to get hurt again.  I've had a pretty terrible school year and this just made it worse.

I talked to my counselor about the situation today, and she said "The girl that's right for you will want only you" and that this girl probably wasn't it.  She [my ex] told me that she realized she didn't have feelings for the other guy, and she only wants me.

Prompt:     As the title says, last night my boyfriend kissed one of his male friends at a party we were both at. I don't care if he's bisexual, but if he's dating me he shouldn't be kissing anybody else regardless of gender, but he doesn't see it that way. He described it as "lad bantz".

I also have a problem with his best friend- 17F- her and I have never got on, and he told me that whenever he's friends with her he can't help but really like her (they weren't really talking when he told me this) and they have a history together- not sure exactly what as he won't elaborate. I don't mind him being best friends with a girl, as my best friend is a boy so it would be hypocritical. I'm more worried about the comment he made and the fact that he's really secretive about when he's spending time with her, to the point where he lies to me about it and I find out through other people.

When I told him how I feel about their friendship- not looking for him to choose between us, I just wanted to be open about how I felt- he basically told me that I was being irrational and stupid.

Prompt:     It has just dawned on me, why not phase out metal/alloy/etc bullets and replace them with rubber / other non-lethal projectiles. They're non-lethal, but still pretty damn hurtful and useful for subduing dangerous persons.

To me, it seems like the perfect solution, so why do I never hear it raised when people are arguing over gun control? I don't claim to be the smartest or most abstract thinker in the world, surely I can't be alone in coming to this idea, so what is wrong with it?

I thought at first that maybe the notion of rubber bullets isn't usually raised due to the injuries that they can cause, but then I realised death is usually a fatal injury. Also, I don't imagine tasers would necessarily be orgasmic for the victim, albeit less fatal than metal bullets.

So, why are we not discussing this? Why are rubber bullets not a good idea?

Combined:  I was once in a situation where i have a gay cousin that used to go hunting with us. He isnt one of those people where you just hear them talk and are like wow he is gay. My dad told me on the way up to the cabin about his 'life style' And i was shocked.. Well of corse i had that on my mind. So  of course the first word that slips out of my mind as soon as we get there and my uncle say we ned to carry everything in is .....wow that gay. i was just glared at by the whole family.

Prompt:     My girlfriend and I have been long distance for about 3 weeks now, and dating 8 1/2 months total. Our relationship is amazing when we're with each other, and I love her to death, but since we've been away I feel as though I'm putting most of the work in the relationship. I'm always the one who texts "How was your day?" I'm always the one who asks when would be a good time to skype. She always ends texts conversations at weird times without saying good bye (which is especially bad for me since I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and not having that closure makes me worry for hours). And just this morning, she said she was going to call me, but she never did. I was too sad to even bring it up with her. I'll be seeing her this weekend, and no, I don't want to end our relationship over this. I love her so much. And no, she's not cheating on me (trust me).

Prompt:     I'm gonna make this short,  I broke contact with my mother years ago she is a bi polar abusive former drug addict. For obvious reasons I chose to cut her out of my life she was a destructive force in my life and doing so has benefited me dramatically. My problem is that in light of this recent news I feel I might have some regrets if I don't speak to her before she dies. On the other hand the idea of her dying doesn't sadden me at all so idk if speaking to her would be worth the verbal abuse that will inevitably ensue. What should I do?

Prompt:     So I did that thing where I took up running with the thought that I just needed a pair of shoes and could go run to my heart's content. After 20km over my first month, I thought I was going well so I did 80km over the next month. Ankles started hurting, went to the doc, turned out I'm extremely flat footed and ran in shoes with virtually no support which eventually killed both my ankles. I stopped running for 1.5 months to rest up and recently started again three weeks ago. I got some new shoes with a lot of support but now I get blisters (never had blisters before) around my right arch and my ankles don't seem to be getting any better. I also saw my City2Surf finishing video and I still run weird. Is this just another "give it time" thing or am I doing something wrong?

Prompt:     I've noticed within the past couple of years that the littlest thing will trigger a very rapid mood swing in me. I will go from feeling fine and happy to feeling extremely angry. Example: I was hanging out with my boyfriend and he tells me that he wants to call it a night because he's tired. All of a sudden, I'm pissed beyond belief, assumed that he just wanted to get rid of me, and told him then and there that I want to break up. He was very shocked because one moment I was fine and making jokes, then I suddenly got mad. A couple hours later I realized how stupid I acted. It always happens like this. Tiny trigger --> explosive anger and overreacting --> acting impulsively --> calming down a couple hours later and realizing my mistake. What is wrong with me? I hate that I am like this. Am I just emotionally immature? How can I stop being this way?

Prompt:     My sister and I are a few years apart and in our 30s. I am the youngest, she is the oldest. I am trying to figure out the best way to be supportive of her as she is working through her marriage problems. She randomly said she was going to visit for a few days, which caught me off guard. Unfortunately I made the mistake of telling her that I already had plans. I didn't realize until a little later that maybe she was reaching out because she needed to get out of the house and take some time away from her spouse.
  
She recently lost her job a few months ago and is stuck at home in a suburb area. They only have one car (they used to commute together) so I can only imagine how hard it is for her right now to be going through difficulties and stuck at home all day.  
  
She is not the type to reach out to me for help, especially with me being the younger sibling, so I feel bad that I missed out on this opportunity to show her support.

Today I was in the bathroom and she hopped on my computer to use Facebook.

She then saw that I routinely searched her name (which is true). The thing is, I use Facebook to creep. I like to just look at people's pictures and posts.

Prompt:     So I volunteer at an animal shelter and I teach new volunteers and show them around and she was one of the new volunteers. We hit it off immediately and became best friends almost instantly. Beforehand, the new volunteers get an email that has my number in case they can't make it or are running late. She texted me saying she was running late for the class, so this is how I got her number. After the 2 hours and we were done, she mentioned she would text me when she got home. I actually initiated the first text and we've pretty much been texting consistently ever since. She has come volunteered at the shelter a few times to hang out with me. She's offered me rides home. We did a training class together and afterwards there was a couch with a ton of room, but she decided to sit next to me to the point where her leg might as well had been on top of mine. There are a few other things that make me wonder but I don't want to type forever. She's a really cool person so I'm okay with things either way.

The professor talks all the class and there's really no opportunity to not even talk to those around me. I really don't know what to do in this situation. It's not like it's a class where we have the opportunity to talk among each other's or something like that. What would you recommend?
I don't want to come off like a creep and walk straight to her after class and talk to her. And if I was to do that what do you even recommend me saying? The more people give advice the better. Thank you.

Prompt:     I've known this guy since freshman year, but it was only halfway through this year I sort of even talked to him. We've been on 3 dates so far, but see each other quite a bit in school . It's not like we can't talk to each other, but we're still in that awkward phase since before a month ago we barely talked at all. We get along really well, and enjoy each others company, but we mostly joke and I feel like I want to know him better. I really want to be able to have legitimate conversations and get to know him better, but I'm not quite sure how/what to ask. So basically I guess what I'm asking is what are some things I should ask him to get to know him that he wouldn't feel uncomfortable talking about.

Prompt:     I (19m) have been cheated on in two of the three relationships I've ever had. The last girl I was dating told me a few months ago that she had been cheating on me, and I didn't know how to react at first. We tried to work our relationship out. She seemed ashamed of it, and acted like she still wanted to be together. I stupidly bought into it, and we worked things out for about another month. We broke up, and the next day, went out and had a fling with the same guy she cheated on me with, and shortly after is now seeing another guy. I know it's all stupid, and I really shouldn't care, but I've been really down lately. My relationship with my parents haven't been that great since middle school, I'm in my first year of college, facing academic probation because of my GPA, and my friends only really seem to talk to me when they have some sort of problem with their life. Throw the whole cheating situation in, and... I just don't know what to do. It makes me wonder if something is wrong with me? I don't know.

Prompt:     I'm in a relationship with a wonderful man for about a year now. No major issues. He's loving, successful and the closest to a soul mate I've ever had. From past conversations I've figured out he was quite the "bad boy" in his youth, but we never really went further into it since it's not who he is now.

Last week, however, we were talking and I questioned a bit more deeply into his past. He admitted to having done a lot of bad things-- getting into fights, "manipulating people to get his way", even getting arrested, and also has quite a history with women, including being unfaithful. I thought he acted out in his youth. Turns out it was in his twenties (so, about 10 years or so ago).

I suppose I might have been too nosey, but I was in no way judgemental. But he then got angry with me for wanting to know all this about him, saying that it was his past, he learned from his mistakes and it's not who he is now.

My best friend and I have been like sisters since high school. We are also both engaged. Both our weddings are far away, but there was no doubt in my mind that she was going to be my maid of honor and I was going to be hers, as we had talked about it several times over the years. 

Cut to today when we had lunch. After some alcohol, she informed me that there was "not going to be room for me in her bridal party" but that I was "still invited to the event and it would still be a good time."

I'm crushed! I understand that it's her wedding and she needs to do what is going to make her happy, but that doesn't change the fact that I am deeply hurt that one of my oldest, closest friends doesn't consider me close enough to even make me a bridesmaid. Moreover, she made it sound like I was only invited to the wedding at all because she felt bad.

Prompt:     Sup, SO and I are going through a rough last few weeks. I think as I am getting my life together more and more we are working through things. We sort of on a break from each other but still hangout a few times a week etc. It's complicated. None the less she recently told me that she likes who I am becoming but that I need to be more, "bad." I am not at all sure what that means. I am a safe, patience, loving guy who does nothing bad in terms of breaking the law or anything. I don't think she means anything sexual either. We are going to go to a party this weekend together and I plan on partaking in underage drinking. Not that I am going to get smashed or anything but might have a few.

Combined:   Sup, SO and I are going through a rough last few weeks. I think as I am getting my life together more and more we are working through things. We sort of on a break from each other but still hangout a few times a week etc. It's complicated. None the less she recently told me that she likes who I am becoming but that I need to be more, "bad." I am not at all sure what that means. I am a safe, patience, loving guy who does nothing bad in terms of breaking the law or anything. I don't think she means anything sexual either. We are going to go to a party this weekend together and I plan on partaking in underage drinking. Not that I am going to get smashed or anything but might have a few. This is completely out of my normal zone and I think maybe what she wants is for me to be a little more risk taking like that. Not sure. Help. I am just a "too nice" kind of guy.

For obvious reasons I chose to cut her out of my life she was a destructive force in my life and doing so has benefited me dramatically. My problem is that in light of this recent news I feel I might have some regrets if I don't speak to her before she dies. On the other hand the idea of her dying doesn't sadden me at all so idk if speaking to her would be worth the verbal abuse that will inevitably ensue. What should I do?

On top of all that, he was told this position was incredibly stable with a low turnover rate. The, nearly, exact opposite is true. His coworkers are conniving, outright hurtful (one of them actually called him a faggot because he mention his elbows were cracking in the dry Denver air), and refuse to train him in any way for the position he's in.

Prompt:     In about a year, I will be moving out of my parents house and in with my grandmother. I had planned to take my dog with me, but lately have been doubting that it is the best thing for her. She is a 10 year old lab, and has arthritis in her back legs. We have two other dogs, one of which is still a puppy. The puppy plays very rough with her, in fact just ten minutes ago she literally leapt down a half a flight of stairs and landed on top of the older dog. I was thinking that it would benefit her to get away from away from that. My fear is that separating her from the other two dogs, as well as the rest of the human members of the family, will cause more harm than good. She has always been most attached to me though, so I would feel like I was abandoning her if she stayed behind. She has never in her life been the only dog in the house, and as such hasn't ever been home alone without at least another dog around. This won't be the case if she moves with me. What does reddit think? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

Prompt:     It started with the regular warning sign, such as getting jealous over small and petty things. I tried to be understanding, so I would cut a (male) friend or two out of my life for my bf. Then he gets upset every time I go out. I tried to be understanding again and go out less. Nothing was ever enough though. I have cancelled upon my friends and family constantly. I have cut so many people out of my life because they were either inappropriate male friends or bad influence -girlfriends.

Now two years later I have no one, except my bf. I am so miserable and bitter, so lonely, so out of love yet so utterly dependent on him. I have no one left, yet I am terrified of going out; I might accidentally meet someone and have fun. It will definitely upset my bf; I cannot lose him as I have no one else left.

Prompt:    It started with the regular warning sign, such as getting jealous over small and petty things. I tried to be understanding, so I would cut a (male) friend or two out of my life for my bf. Then he gets upset every time I go out. I tried to be understanding again and go out less. Nothing was ever enough though. I have cancelled upon my friends and family constantly. I have cut so many people out of my life because they were either inappropriate male friends or bad influence -girlfriends.

Now two years later I have no one, except my bf. I am so miserable and bitter, so lonely, so out of love yet so utterly dependent on him. I have no one left, yet I am terrified of going out; I might accidentally meet someone and have fun. It will definitely upset my bf; I cannot lose him as I have no one else left. 

I know this was not a good relationships-post, sorry. I guess I needed to rant and someone to tell me that it can get better. I need you to tell me your story and tell me that it can get better. 

I'm so alone.

Prompt:     I just came back from meeting with her and I'm fuming, so I will be as coherent as I can. Throwaway account in use.

My best friend and I have been like sisters since high school. We are also both engaged. Both our weddings are far away, but there was no doubt in my mind that she was going to be my maid of honor and I was going to be hers, as we had talked about it several times over the years. 

Cut to today when we had lunch. After some alcohol, she informed me that there was "not going to be room for me in her bridal party" but that I was "still invited to the event and it would still be a good time."

I'm crushed! I understand that it's her wedding and she needs to do what is going to make her happy, but that doesn't change the fact that I am deeply hurt that one of my oldest, closest friends doesn't consider me close enough to even make me a bridesmaid. Moreover, she made it sound like I was only invited to the wedding at all because she felt bad. 

This is so out of left field that I feel like I need an explanation as to why she would cut me out this way, but I'm afraid of

Prompt:     I broke up with my girlfriend around nine months ago.  We were in a very happy relationship, but I got cold feet and ran away. She recently emailed me again and told me that her feelings are still very much intact for me, and that it was difficult to keep any kind of contact with me. I feel very much the same way.

Anyway, I asked her if she were interested in meeting up again under the pretext of maybe starting to date again if we took it very slowly. The last thing in the world that I want is to hurt her. I feel like a complete shit for dumping her in the first place, and I've had a very difficult time getting over her. The only problem is that I'm afraid that I might end up being a shit again. Is there ever a scenario where you can get back with an ex and end up happy about the situation? 

Thanks in advance for your help, Reddit. Also, I'm quite drunk right now. Sorry for my childish explanations.

Luckily, she starts talking to me again, we start hanging out again, only it seems more serious this time.

She lives thankfully, I go and visit her in the hospital until she gets transferred to a mental health facility, where only the patients can call you, you can't call the patients. I send her letters all of the time, only I haven't heard from her in a week, and I realize I'm desperately in love with this girl. I don't know now if she even wants to be with me when she gets out. I've been drinking a lot more than I should be at this point, I've even taken up smoking just to calm my nerves. The question is, what the fuck do I do?

Prompt:     I have a bit of  history of paranoia, and general mental illness. I go to a therapist for this, but my intrusive thoughts are constant. My friend also feels something similar. I am having a hard time identifying the emotion, and finding out how to fix it. 

Whenever I look at my boyfriend's online profiles, such as Facebook or this movie-review website, or even his friends' profiles (especially when he is mentioned) I feel this negative emotion that almost is like a burning in my body.  This also happens when our mutual friends invite me to an event before he does, and once they made plans in front of me. But that's pretty much a generic "left out" emotion.

My therapist has told me to use "I Am [feeling]" statements to boil down emotions in a moment, but I can't identify why I am feeling bad.  Some statements I could use include:

I Am Lonely / Left Out: 
Am I feeling left out from not being a part of his friend group? Do I feel bad that I have to learn these things about him (favorite music and movies, past Facebook activity, activities with friends, etc) through social media, instead of from him? "He'll tell the internet before me?"

Prompt:     I created this post, and have read through a lot of the comments saying that nuclear power is bad, and most of the reasons why are simply ignorance.
Let me stress this here, THE PROBLEM IS NOT WITH NUCLEAR POWER, its with the old reactors we are using.
For instance, Thorium reactors can't meltdown, can't produce nuclear weapons, they produce power much more cheaply and efficiently than conventional uranium power plants. Thorium is so common that it is an annoyance when digging for more valuable metals. The only reason the world went with uranium instead of thorium is because we all wanted to get nuclear weapons from this too. We knew about this shit in the 1950's for fuck's sake.
SO DON'T BLAME NUCLEAR POWER, blame your fucktarded governments.

Also, Bill Gates recently did a TED talk where he described a process that he had simulated which would allow us to react uranium 235, and other waste elements from uranium power plants. Essentially, a way to turn all the radioactive waste that we thought was going to fuck our planet into energy. RIGHT NOW, we have enough nuclear waste to power the Earth for 1000 YEARS.

So don't get me wrong, I think that

Prompt:     Hi, I'm from California and my grandma has been in a sticky situation with her home.

A neighbor next door to my grandma was seeking reimbursement for repairs since there were holes in their house that came from my grandma's yard.

But it turns out the previous owner of my grandma's house caused those damages. 

So after inspections and everything, the neighbor's insurance reimbursed him about $1600 to make the repairs.

Now's the sticky part: The insurance company's lawyers sent a letter to my grandma asking for reimbursement for what they paid the neighbor. 

We've tried contacting our home insurance to deal with them but have been getting no calls back. We were thinking of writing a letter to OUR insurance company including the letter from the neighbor's lawyer and let them handle everything.

My grandma is just worried about losing the house. Thank you guys so much in advance.

Prompt:     So my wife and I split a few months ago and have filed for divorce. Since then, I have met a girl who I really like. We hung out with a group of friends and I thought we really hit it off. We have mutual friends and she knows my situation, and when I asked her if she would want to hang out again some time, she said she would, but that under the circumstances she thinks it's best we stay friends.

I told her I appreciated her being direct with me and that I completely respect where she's coming from. Then I texted her saying I was thinking of getting the group together and asked if she wanted to join, but she never responded. I am a little bit concerned that I rushed to asking her on a date, since the time we had hung out and had a lot of fun was the same night I told that group of friends about my ex and I splitting, so obviously the subject was talked about some (nothing bad, we are on good terms, but I'm sure I was a little down/zoned out at some parts of the night).

Prompt:     My wife and I are 30, live in the UK and are thinking about adoption. As we're pretty young and don't already have children, we would ideally like to adopt a baby. 

Recently we've been discussing would it be better to adopt a baby from the UK (where my wife is from and we live), from Ireland (where I'm from) or from China/Africa/somewhere where an orphan has even less chance of a good life. My concern is whether this route is unfair on a child, taking it away from its culture and homeland when we'd know nothing about its national identity. But then maybe that's irrelevant if the kid has a loving happy family and life...

We get along really well, and enjoy each others company, but we mostly joke and I feel like I want to know him better. I really want to be able to have legitimate conversations and get to know him better, but I'm not quite sure how/what to ask. So basically I guess what I'm asking is what are some things I should ask him to get to know him that he wouldn't feel uncomfortable talking about.
Output:      son can you do something for me?

Prompt:     I'm going to talk to her today in like an hr. She called me this morning and made sure I was planning on talking later. She then said "I don't want to lose you." I told her we would talk at 5:30. 

I'm prepared to stick with my decision not to continue to wait for her. I'm pretty sure that nothing has changed for her. She wants to be single. And I'm not willing to keep going through this. 

I'm not looking forward to hearing her tell me how much she loves me. and I know she will bring up the whole "if i'm going to be with a guy, it'll be you." That one has been said way to many times (by her.)  I expect her to cry. That is going to be so hard. But I'm done.

Prompt:     My 25 year old brother has Klinefelters syndrome (chromosomal XXY). He has always been a bit odd and can be very inappropriate at times. He does things before he thinks. Im a girl and he has said sexual comments to me in the past.

I was using his computer because mine broke and I accidentally found HEAPS of adult baby (sometimes called diaper fetish) porn of his. Stuff that he had written himself where he is fantasising he is the baby. And lots of other weird porn. 

He is a child care worker and also looks after a family friends young son. I am an open minded person and I'm not saying that he is a risk to children but I am not informed about the topic enough to know if there is something I should be concerned about. If anyone has advice that would be really appreciated.

Prompt:     I'm deeply in love with my boyfriend but lately I've been feeling uncomfortable about how he talks to his exes. The first year of our relationship was long distance and I trusted him completely. Now that we live together I still trust him but see that he frequently chats with his exes, one in particular he was madly in love with for many years.

He's a friendly guy and I'm happy he can stay on good terms with people. His conversations seem friendly, perhaps playfully flirtatious, nothing to write home about. But to be completely honest, it does unsettle me a bit. Maybe because I do not chat with my exes so it's hard for me to understand being friends with people you used to be attracted to and have sex with from his perspective. I would feel incredibly awkward talking to my exes, and I think he would be justified being uncomfortable with that too.

I've told him how I felt and he reassured me I have nothing to worry about, that they're only friends. I believe him. He's given me no overt reason to be suspicious but I just cannot shake how it makes me worry. Every time I think about it my stomach turns. What if it's my intuition telling me something is wrong? I

I'm reading Dune at the moment as my first book, and we've been told the other text can be a film instead of a book if we're so inclined. So, r/books, what are some of your favourite books/movies that share themes to Frank Herbert's Dune?

Prompt:     Hi all,

Hopefully this is the right forum :).  My dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (acinar cell carcinoma) about a month ago and recently started chemotherapy.  There's a lot of literature out there about all sorts of herbal remedies that people have taken in order to (purportedly) boost their immune system, help their body get rid of toxic chemicals, etc.  My dad came across this website:  and asked me to do some research.  The scientist (and cynic) in me takes one look at it and thinks it's a scam, trying to get people to cave in when they're weakest, but interestingly enough, some of the products (like zeolite), I've heard about from other places too.

So I'm wondering if anyone has personally or knows someone who's tried these sorts of things and can testify they work?  Some of the products the website talks about are zeolite, Oxy-E, and other things to help "cleanse and balance" the body.  I think most of it is baloney, but at the same time, my dad is in stage IV, so I feel like I should explore as many routes as possible.
